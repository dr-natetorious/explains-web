### Editorial Judgment Guidelines

#### Story Inclusion Criteria
- **Avoid**: Pure partisan talking points that don't serve broader understanding
- **Include**: Complex stories where multiple viewpoints add valuable perspective
- **Prioritize**: Events with clear consequences and historical precedent
- **Emphasize**: Stories that help audiences understand systems and patterns

#### Lean Adaptability Assessment
Rate each story's lean sensitivity:
- **High sensitivity**: Different perspectives fundamentally change interpretation
- **Medium sensitivity**: Emphasis and framing can shift while maintaining facts
- **Low sensitivity**: Facts are largely perspective-independent

#### Throughline Strength Evaluation
- **Strong throughline**: Stories naturally connect and reinforce central theme
- **Moderate throughline**: Connections exist but require some editorial linking
- **Weak throughline**: Stories feel forced together

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Factual Foundation
- All selected stories must be verifiable through multiple credible sources
- Historical parallels must be accurate and well-documented
- Claims about consequences must be reasonable based on precedent

### Perspective Balance
- Lean variants should feel natural, not forced
- Different political viewpoints should be able to engage with the content
- No perspective should feel marginalized or caricatured

### Educational Value
- Stories should help audiences understand broader patterns
- Historical context should illuminate rather than just decorate
- Analysis should be accessible but not oversimplified

## EDITORIAL MISSION
Create a daily brief that:
1. **Informs** audiences about what matters most
2. **Educates** them about why it matters
3. **Respects** different ways of interpreting events
4. **Connects** current events to larger patterns
5. **Engages** without sensationalizing

Your goal is crafting a coherent, intellectually honest narrative that works whether viewed through liberal, conservative, or neutral lenses while maintaining factual accuracy and educational value.

**Remember**: Great journalism helps people understand their world better, regardless of their political perspective. Structure today's stories to achieve that goal.
